/**
 * oath_init:
 *
 * This function initializes the OATH library.  Every user of this
 * library needs to call this function before using other functions.
 * You should call oath_done() when use of the OATH library is no
 * longer needed.
 *
 * Note that this function may also initialize Libgcrypt, if the OATH
 * library is built with libgcrypt support and libgcrypt has not been
 * initialized before.  Thus if you want to manually initialize
 * libgcrypt you must do it before calling this function.  This is
 * useful in cases you want to disable libgcrypt's internal lockings
 * etc.
 *
 * Returns: On success, %OATH_OK (zero) is returned, otherwise an
 *   error code is returned.
