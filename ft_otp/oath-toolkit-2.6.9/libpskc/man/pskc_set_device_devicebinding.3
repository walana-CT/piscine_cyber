.SH NAME
pskc_set_device_devicebinding \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <pskc.h>
.sp
.BI "void pskc_set_device_devicebinding(pskc_key_t * " key ", const char * " devbind ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pskc_key_t * key" 12
a \fBpskc_key_t\fP handle, from \fBpskc_get_keypackage()\fP.
.IP "const char * devbind" 12
a string with device binding to set.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set the PSKC KeyPackage DeviceInfo DeviceBinding value.  This
element allows a provisioning server to ensure that the key is
going to be loaded into the device for which the key provisioning
request was approved.  The device is bound to the request using a
device identifier, e.g., an International Mobile Equipment Identity
(IMEI) for the phone, or an identifier for a class of identifiers,
e.g., those for which the keys are protected by a Trusted Platform
Module (TPM).

The pointer is stored in \fIcontainer\fP, not a copy of the data, so you
must not deallocate the data before another call to this function
or the last call to any function using \fIcontainer\fP.
