.SH ARGUMENTS

a \fBpskc_t\fP handle, from \fBpskc_init()\fP.
.IP "const char * version" 12
pointer to version string to set.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set the PSKC KeyContainer Version attribute.  Normally this string
is always "1.0" and a missing field is a syntax error according to
the PSKC schema.

The pointer is stored in \fIcontainer\fP, not a copy of the data, so you
must not deallocate the data before another call to this function
or the last call to any function using \fIcontainer\fP.
