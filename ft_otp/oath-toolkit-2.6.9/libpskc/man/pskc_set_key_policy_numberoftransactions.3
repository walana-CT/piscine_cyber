carried within the PSKC document can be used by an application
after having received it.  When this element is omitted, there is
no restriction regarding the number of times a key can be used.

Note that while the PSKC specification uses the XML data type
"nonNegativeInteger" for this variable, this implementation
restricts the size of the value to 64\-bit integers.
