.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function initializes the OATH library.  Every user of this
library needs to call this function before using other functions.
You should call \fBoath_done()\fP when use of the OATH library is no
longer needed.

Note that this function may also initialize Libgcrypt, if the OATH
library is built with libgcrypt support and libgcrypt has not been
initialized before.  Thus if you want to manually initialize
libgcrypt you must do it before calling this function.  This is
useful in cases you want to disable libgcrypt's internal lockings
etc.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBOATH_OK\fP (zero) is returned, otherwise an
error code is returned.
