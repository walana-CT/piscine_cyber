.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get the PSKC KeyPackage Key Policy NumberOfTransactions value.  The
value in this element indicates the maximum number of times a key
carried within the PSKC document can be used by an application
after having received it.  When this element is omitted, there is
no restriction regarding the number of times a key can be used.

Note that while the PSKC specification uses the XML data type
"nonNegativeInteger" for this variable, this implementation
restricts the size of the value to 64\-bit integers.

If \fIpresent\fP is non\-NULL, it will be 0 if the Counter field is not
present or 1 if it was present.
.SH "RETURNS"
an integer holding the content.
