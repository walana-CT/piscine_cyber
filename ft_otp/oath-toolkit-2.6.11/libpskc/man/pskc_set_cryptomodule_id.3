Set the PSKC KeyPackage CryptoModule Id value.  This element
carries a unique identifier for the CryptoModule and is
implementation specific.  As such, it helps to identify a specific
CryptoModule to which the key is being or was provisioned.

The pointer is stored in \fIcontainer\fP, not a copy of the data, so you
must not deallocate the data before another call to this function
or the last call to any function using \fIcontainer\fP.
