.SH NAME
pskc_get_key_data_timedrift \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <pskc.h>
.sp
.BI "uint32_t pskc_get_key_data_timedrift(pskc_key_t * " key ", int * " present ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "pskc_key_t * key" 12
a \fBpskc_key_t\fP handle, from \fBpskc_get_keypackage()\fP.
.IP "int * present" 12
output variable indicating whether data was provided or not.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get the PSKC KeyPackage Key Data TimeDrift value.  This element
contains the device clock drift value for time\-based OTP
algorithms.  The integer value (positive or negative drift) that
indicates the number of time intervals that a validation server has
established the device clock drifted after the last successful
authentication.  So, for example, if the last successful
authentication established a device time value of 8 intervals from
a specific start date but the validation server determines the time
value at 9 intervals, the server SHOULD record the drift as \-1.

If \fIpresent\fP is non\-NULL, it will be 0 if the field is not present
or 1 if it was present.
.SH "RETURNS"
an integer holding the content.
