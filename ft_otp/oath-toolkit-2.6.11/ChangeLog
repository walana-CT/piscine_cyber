2021-05-01  Jason Graham  <jgraham@compukix.net>

	Removed empty line in pam_oath/configure.ac

	Moved the call to pam_modutil_getpwnam() to within parser_usersfile_str() since it is only used there.
	This cleans up the implementation in pam_sm_authenticate().

	Removed additional string length checks.
	The string length accounting is included in the original string length. The additional
	accounting was originally added for debugging purposes.

	Reverted changes to liboath/tests/tst_usersfile.c.
	This is due to reverting oath_authenticate_usersfile() where the
	usersfile uid no longer passed as an argument.

	Fixed missing OATH_FILE_STAT_ERROR error string.

	Reverted inclusion of sys/types.h.

2021-05-01  Jason Graham  <jgraham@compukix.net>

	Changed new users file to have the same uid and gid as original users file.
	This reverts the change to the liboath API which required passing the
	uid for the users file to oath_authenticate_usersfile(), but this is
	no longer necessary/needed.

	The parse_userfile_str() procedure has been simplified and cleaned up.

2021-05-01  Jason Graham  <jgraham@compukix.net>

	Updated calls to oath_authenticate_usersfile() in tst_usersfile.c to conform to API changes.
	The API change adds the userfile_uid parmeter.

	Removed NULL check prior to usersfile free() to conform to Debian's "avoid_if_before_free" rule.

	Change stack allocation of usersfile to be heap allocation in pam_sm_authenticate().
	This is to address the "Avoid stack allocations of size PATH_MAX"
	Debian build requirement.

2021-05-01  Jason Graham  <jgraham@compukix.net>

	Added support for user based placeholder values in pam_oath usersfile string.
	These changes introduce the the "${USER}" and "${HOME}" placeholder
	values for the "usersfile" string in the pam_oath configuration
	file. The placeholder values allow the user credentials file to be
	stored in a file path that is relative to the user, and mimicks
	similar behavior found in google-authenticator-libpam.

	The motivation for these changes is to allow for non-privileged
	processes to use pam_oath (e.g., for 2FA with
	xscreensaver). Non-priviledged and non-suid programs are unable to use
	pam_oath. These changes are a proposed alternative to a suid helper
	binary as well.

	The user credential file ownership is automatically adjusted if
	"${USER}" and/or "${HOME}" is used. The default is the owner of the
	calling process (as returned by getuid()), but if either placeholder
	is used the UID of the user is obtained from
	pam_modutil_getpwnam(). The ownership is changed just prior the
	renaming the new modified user crediential file, while the lock is in
	place.

2021-04-30  Simon Josefsson  <simon@josefsson.org>

	Add, so that merge requests and forks get CI automatically.

	Make it easier to re-use pskctool test framework outside of build.

2021-04-04  Jason Graham  <jgraham@compukix.net>

	Updated liboath man pages project URL to use PACKAGE_URL from liboath/configure.ac AC_INIT.
	This change adds the '-pkg-url' argument to liboath/man/gdoc to set
	the project home page URL. Both '-pkg-name' and '-pkg-url' are needed
	to include the project home page url with '-bugsto'.

2021-03-09  Simon Josefsson  <simon@josefsson.org>

2020-11-16  Matthias Gerstner  <matthias.gerstner@suse.de>

	pam_oath: assign safe default to alwaysok config member
	The way this was before allowed for the PAM authentication to
	potentially succeed when the first `goto done` line is hit. If the
	undefined data behind alwaysok is non-zero (which is quite probable)
	this would happen.

	In theory a local attacker could try to exhaust memory just enough to
	hit this spot and get e.g. root access.

2020-11-11  Antoine Beaupré  <anarcat@debian.org>

	fail gracefully for missing users
	when the pam module is enabled, it forces *all* users to immediately
	start using OATH, or they can't login at all.

	a more progressive approach would seem more reasonable to me,
	especially since each user need to get an admin user to update the
	central file for them.

	this patch adds an early check to the users file and makes sure the
	user exists before prompting for a password.

	if the user is missing, it exits early with a standard error code
	(PAM_USER_UNKNOWN) which can then be ignored in the PAM configuration
	(as shown in the README file). this leaves the policy decision up to
	the admin (and defaults to "fail closed").

	if the user is present, the code path remains the same except the
	usersfile is scanned twice, which may be a performance penalty on very
	slow filesystems or very large files. the only workaround I can think
	of for this would be to load the whole file into memory, but this
	could have significant memory impact on large files.

	the function used (`oath_authenticate_usersfile`) is a little overkill
	as it actually goes and tries to authenticate the user with an empty
	password. this is harmless because the file isn't updated if the OTP
	is incorrect and because no warning is sent to syslog.

	a possible improvement on this would be to have a warning shown to the
	user inciting them to configure OATH or to warn them about a possible
	typo in their username before they enter their regular passphrase
